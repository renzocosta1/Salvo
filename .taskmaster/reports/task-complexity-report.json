		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Expansion & Seed Data",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the schema expansion into specific SQL migration files: 1) Profile table updates and enum modifications, 2) Geographical hierarchy tables (districts, counties), 3) Mission and Ballot system tables (XP lookups, endorsements), and 4) RLS policies and Maryland seed data script.",
			"reasoning": "While conceptually straightforward, this is the foundational layer for all other tasks. It requires careful handling of constraints, RLS policies, and seeding data correctly to avoid breaking existing functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Address Onboarding & Mapbox Geocoding Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) AddressEntryScreen UI development, 2) Mapbox Geocoding API integration service, 3) Geo-spatial matching logic (point-in-polygon or lookup), 4) Profile update logic with error handling, and 5) Manual fallback selection UI.",
			"reasoning": "Involves external API integration, spatial logic (matching coordinates to legislative districts), and mission-critical onboarding flow. Ensuring accuracy in district mapping is technically challenging."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Captain & Leadership Assignment UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify subtasks for: 1) Role-gated Leadership tab structure, 2) Drill-down navigation (State > County > District), 3) User search and filtering within geographical context, and 4) Role promotion/assignment logic with database validation.",
			"reasoning": "Requires building a multi-level management UI and careful role-based access control. The complexity lies in the navigation flow and ensuring data integrity (e.g., one captain per district)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Mission Creation Dropdown System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "List subtasks for: 1) Dynamic form container with conditional field rendering, 2) Mission type and XP lookup integration, 3) Role-based scope locking logic, and 4) Form submission and directive creation service.",
			"reasoning": "Involves complex form logic where fields change based on selected mission types and user permissions. It bridges the UI with the newly created schema elements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Social Media Link Opening & Frictionless Engagement",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Expo-linking and WebBrowser utility implementation, and 2) DirectiveCard UI updates to support deep links.",
			"reasoning": "Relatively simple task using standard Expo libraries, though testing across different social media apps (Twitter, Reddit) adds some minor effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Enhanced AI Verification Logic (Gemini)",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Edge Function parameter updates for new types, 2) Refinement of Gemini system prompts for specific engagement checks, 3) PFP visual comparison logic, and 4) Comprehensive testing suite for various mission scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to prompt engineering requirements for Gemini and the need to accurately verify diverse mission types (likes vs. keywords vs. images) via AI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Digital Ballot UI (Main Quest)",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Main Quest screen data fetching with complex joins, 2) Grouped list rendering for races and candidates, and 3) Commitment toggle logic and persistence.",
			"reasoning": "Requires a clean, high-impact UI (Neon Green styling) and efficient data fetching to show personalized ballots based on the user's district."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Ballot Management Admin Tools",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify subtasks for: 1) Ballot management dashboard, 2) Race and Candidate CRUD forms, 3) Ballot preview mode, and 4) Publication workflow logic.",
			"reasoning": "Standard CRUD operations but with a high degree of nested data (Ballot > Race > Candidate) and the requirement for a 'Preview' mode."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Notification Discipline & Retention Strategy",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Onboarding notification permission screen, 2) Scoped notification triggering logic (Database triggers or Edge Functions), and 3) Integration with push provider for targeted delivery.",
			"reasoning": "The challenge lies in the logic for 'scoping' notifications to specific districts or counties rather than just the implementation of the UI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Multi-State Scalability & Final Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Multi-state schema audit and filtering updates, 2) E2E testing of the full user lifecycle (Registration > Geocoding > Content), 3) Performance profiling for concurrent users, and 4) Final production environment configuration.",
			"reasoning": "This is a holistic task requiring extensive testing and ensuring the architectural patterns scale beyond Maryland. It serves as the final QA gate for the entire system."
