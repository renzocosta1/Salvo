		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Database Schema Expansion for Maryland Primary Alpha",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the SQL migrations into separate subtasks for each table modification: profiles updates, md_ballots/md_ballot_races/md_ballot_candidates creation, user_ballot_commitments and election_day_verifications, synced_contacts, and directives columns. Include subtasks for constraint verification and initial testing.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward Supabase SQL migrations with multiple tables and constraints, but low cognitive complexity as it's declarative work with clear test strategy. Multiple changes warrant subtasks for manageability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Maryland Geographic Lookup Engine",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: 1) Data file creation and validation for maryland_districts.json, 2) Implementation of the lookup service with JSON parsing or geo-query logic, 3) Unit testing focused on Montgomery County and MD-6 accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "Involves data curation, custom lookup logic, and geospatial approximation, increasing cognitive complexity beyond simple CRUD. Dependency on schema adds coordination overhead."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Onboarding: Address Entry & Geographic Lock",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks: 1) Add Address Entry screen to Expo Router flow, 2) Integrate Mapbox Geocoding API for lat/lng conversion, 3) Integrate District Lookup and profile update logic, 4) Implement fallback manual selection UI and E2E testing.",
			"reasoning": "Combines UI development, external API integration (Mapbox), service calls, and state management in onboarding flow, leading to higher cyclomatic complexity from error handling and fallbacks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "AI-Powered Voter Registration Verification (Enlistment)",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Camera UI implementation, 2) Client-side image redaction with expo-image-manipulator, 3) Supabase Edge Function creation, 4) Gemini 1.5 Flash API integration and prompting, 5) Matching logic, UI feedback, and testing with sample cards.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity from image processing, client-side manipulation, Edge Function deployment, AI API integration, privacy-sensitive matching, and robust error handling, aligning with high cognitive load metrics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "War Room HUD: Polymarket Integration & Countdown Timers",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) Polymarket Gamma API integration and response parsing, 2) Edge Function for 15-min polling and caching, 3) UI components for countdowns, gauges, and Neon Green styling with simulation testing.",
			"reasoning": "Multiple external API, caching, polling, and custom UI components introduce moderate complexity through async operations and real-time updates."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Weekly Notification Pulse & Oath Renewal",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) expo-notifications setup for recurring Saturday scheduling and deep-linking, 2) Oath Renewal animation screen with XP award logic and testing.",
			"reasoning": "Simple notification config and basic animation; low complexity as it leverages established Expo libraries with straightforward DB update."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Relational Raid: Contact Sync & Recruitment Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down: 1) expo-contacts permission and sync, 2) Hashing and storage in synced_contacts, 3) Matching against user base, 4) UI for tactical icons and SMS invitations, 5) Deferred XP logic tied to invitee verification.",
			"reasoning": "Privacy-sensitive contact handling, hashing, matching, SMS integration, and conditional XP awards create high complexity with multiple failure modes and dependencies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Digital Ballot UI with 'Neon Green' Endorsements",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) Create Ballot tab and fetch/filter district-specific data, 2) Implement Neon Green styling and Commit to Vote toggles with DB saves, 3) Add Ballot Completion progress tracker and mock data testing.",
			"reasoning": "Standard UI with data fetching and styling; moderate complexity from district filtering and commitment persistence."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Tactical Mission Set: GPS & Verification Logic",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Update Commands tab for mission display, 2) Early Raid GPS check-in and photo upload, 3) Election Day Google Maps deep-linking, 4) Gemini verification for photos and Squad Status UI.",
			"reasoning": "Integrates GPS geofencing, external app linking, AI photo verification, and peer status aggregation, resulting in high integration complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Data Seeding Script for Montgomery County & MD-6",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subtasks: 1) Script for inserting missions into directives table, 2) Comprehensive ballot data population for districts with endorsement flags and validation.",
			"reasoning": "Routine data scripting with known structures; low complexity as it's one-off insertion following schema, with clear verification path."
